# DiagnosBot 🤖⚕️

**AI-Powered Portable Diagnosis Assistant for Global Health Equity**

DiagnosBot is an open-source AI prototype that combines **computer vision** and **medical natural language processing** to provide educational diagnostic support in low-resource and remote settings. It analyzes medical images (skin conditions, chest X-rays, etc.) and patient symptoms to suggest possible conditions — fully designed to run offline on affordable hardware like Raspberry Pi or Android phones.

Built solo by a former PHP developer from Pakistan transitioning into AI and robotics.

## 🌍 Mission
Over 3.6 billion people lack access to basic diagnostic tools (WHO). Early detection can reduce mortality by up to 40% for many diseases. DiagnosBot aims to bridge this gap with accessible, privacy-focused, edge-deployable AI.

## 🚀 Features (In Development)
- **Computer Vision Module** – CNN-based detection (target: 92–96% accuracy on ISIC skin lesions & ChestX-ray14 datasets)
- **Medical Chatbot** – Fine-tuned biomedical LLM (BioBERT / Llama-3) for symptom triage
- **Robotic Simulation** – ROS2 + Gazebo virtual diagnosis arm for scanning and interaction demo
- **Offline-First** – TensorFlow Lite for edge deployment (no internet required)
- **Bias & Ethics Audits** – Built-in fairness checks and transparency reports

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Streamlit (web demo)
- ROS2 + Gazebo (robot simulation)
- SQLite / Pandas
- Docker (future containerization)
